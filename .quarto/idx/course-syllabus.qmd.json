The topics include basic concepts of sampling methods, method of data collection, introductory methods in descriptive and inferential statistics. Specific topics include methods of describing data, correlation & regression analysis, time series analysis, index numbers and probability. Students will be exposed to statistical project which involve analyzing primary or secondary data in enhancing their understanding in solving real problems. Statistical Analysis using Excel or SPSS will be introduced.  \n\n## *Syllabus Content*  \n\n1.
